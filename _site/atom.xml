    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many homeless people roam our streets today—not because
they want to—but
because they have no choice.
Not everybody is given a privileged life.
Some are not even given the chance to get a good education,all the more a decent job to survive the hardships of life.
&lt;img src=&quot;/res/Homeless_Veteran_in_New_York.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Homeless&quot; /&gt;
Every man has a story.
Some of them might even keep their stories to themselves, but let us not judge them for what we see on the surface.
Many homeless people are considered a nuisance, especially by those who are not directly concerned.
When some of us see a homeless person dressed as this person in the video, our usual initial reaction is to move away.
They are people too, they just don’t have the means to feed and support themselves at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SFD is a worldwide celebration of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Our goal in this celebration is to educate the worldwide public about the benefits of using high quality FOSS in education, in government, at home, and in business &amp;ndash; in short, everywhere! The non-profit organization Software Freedom International coordinates SFD at a global level, providing support, giveaways and a point of collaboration, but volunteer teams around the world organize the local SFD events to impact their own communities.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Linux User Group or Linux Users' Group (LUG) or GNU/Linux User Group (GLUG) is a private, generally non-profit or not-for-profit organization that provides support and/or education for Linux users, particularly for inexperienced users. The term commonly refers to local groups that meet in person, but is also used to refer to online support groups that may have members spread over a very wide area and which do not organize, or are not dependent on, physical meetings. Many LUGs encompass FreeBSD and other free Unix-based operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, machining, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialize and collaborate.[1] Hackerspaces have also been compared to other community-operated spaces with similar aims and mechanisms such as Fab Lab, Men&amp;rsquo;s Sheds, and with commercial &amp;ldquo;for profit&amp;rdquo; companies such as TechShop.&lt;/p&gt;
